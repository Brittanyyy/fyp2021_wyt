        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2">Ever since Arnault came into the office, LVMH has been committed to merger and acquisition in order to expand business scale, increase market share, and lessen the reliance on Louis Vuitton and Dior. According to the revenue contribution, frequency of brand name appeared in the 2020 annual report, and the brand awareness, we could divide all of brands into 3 levels. <br>
          <br>Level A includes brands Louis Vuitton and Dior. The previous one is own-label, and Dior is the first brand acquired by Arnault. These two brands are the most important parts of the whole group, especially Louis Vuitton that nearly took half of the profit contribution. According to Forbes 2020 brand value ranking, Louis Vuitton is also the brand with the highest value at $15 billion in the luxury industry, which is 1.4 times larger than the second one Gucci. 38<br>
          <br>Celine, Fendi, Loewe, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs, Kenzo and Loro Piana are categorized into level B. Although there is a volatility of Celine and Fendi’s sales, income generally remained above $1 billion dollars in recent years. As for Loewe, Givenchy, Marc Jacobs and Kenzo, their revenue is not as much as Celine and Fendi, but the brand awareness is far more than brands in level C. <br>

                <br>I interviewed Judy Li, Ruby Xie and Cindy Han based on this point. All of them are female university students who nearly spent 10 thousand a year on buying luxury products. They collectively regard Celine’s minimalist design as an attractive point, which is not as fussy as Louis Vuitton. “If you classify consumers into different groups based on their preferences, I definitely want to be the one in Celine.”, said Judy. “LV is excessively popular these days, their consumers cover all kinds of people, like rich, middle or even lower class, also from young adults to old people.”<br>

        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-1">Thus also one of the reasons why LVMH could sit in the leading position as the company caught attention from the young-blood generation.<br>
          <br>For level C brands, it contains EDUN, Nicholas Kirkwood, Thomas Pink, Rimowa, Berluti, Pucci, and Moynat, which helped LVMH successfully diversify itself from business segment, price, and style layouts.<br>
          <br>Each level has their emphasis, level A and B are more mixed and covers almost all categories in the luxury industry. However, the C level focuses more on unicity and helps the group supplement their brand matrix. For instance, Nicholas Kirkwood concentrates on haute couture, Thomas Pink products formal clothing, and Rimowa is primarily based on suitcases. Various gradients in the brand matrix upgrade the differentiation strategy of LVMH and help the company expand in multiple aspects.<br>

        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-3">Artists like Marc Jacobs, Stephen Sprouse, Takashi Murakami, Christian Dior, John Galliano, Saint Laurent, and Alexander McQueen still cooperate or work for LVMH, which future weaken competitiveness of same-level artists who were employed by other luxury groups, such as Kering that only has two designers, Tom Ford and Saint Laurent. These excellent artists led the fashion trends by shifting styles, innovating in material and design, and extending the product variety. <br>
          <br>Taking Louis Vuitton as an example, in 1888, the founder of Louis Vuitton used the Damier checkerboard which consisted of “Square” with a registered trademark to take the place of the original “Beige stripe” and to honor his father, Damier upgraded the design by integrating LV letters, four-petal flower patterns, and diamond shapes together in the later, which is also called Monogram logo, but these changes could not satisfy consumers’ interests at all, the brand went downhill because of its expensive price and fixed pattern. In 1997, Arnault fended off doubts and transferred this French national brand to a young American designer --- Marc Jacobs's hands. This man added lively color into the traditional design, created the series of Monogram Multicolore handbags with Takashi Murakami and brought more than $300 million dollars earnings that took 64% of revenue of Fashion &amp; Leather Goods at that year.<br>

        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2">The boom period (around 2000) of LVMH’s mergers and acquisitions perfectly match the financial crisis in 1997, 911 incident and Nasdaq crash in 2001. Purchasing of Sephora, FENDI, Zenith, TAG Heuer, and Chaumet all occurred between these times with knockdown price. For example, Donna Karen was just sold at US$234 million in 2001, which is 0.34 times of its sales revenue and 1/10 of the average benchmark indicator.<br>
          <br>Family revolution also made Arnault successfully become the most powerful stockholder as he planned. The acquisition of Loro Piana in 2013 happened when the sixth-generation heir Sergio retired to vice president, who was seriously ill and died shortly afterward at the end of 2013. One year later, Arnault shifted target to Lambrays, the top winery in the whole world, and also started when the previous owner Freund passed away. Freund’s widow was nearly 80 years old, and his son was not interested in inheriting the business at all, so 10.72 hectares of Lambrays interfaced to Arnault only at 100 million euros. In addition, a tough time in the brand development is also a great point to Arnault, as the company acquired Celine when the brand’s net profit lost 16 million US dollars in 1996.<br>

        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2">Founded as the latest sector among the group, Watch &amp; Jewellery started growing at a late time in the 1990s. Before the joining of Bulgari, neither brand positioning, prices nor consumer recognition of 50 brands under LVMH were inferior to competitor Richemont who not only had the top brand Cartier but also led the trend in the advanced watch industry at Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie (SIHH) annually. In 2010, income from Watch &amp; Jewellery of the group was only ⅘ of Swatch and ¾ of Richemont. <br>
          <br>In March 2011, LVMH purchased 51% shares of Bulgari, the world's third-largest jewelry group, at 3.7 billion euros. During this acquisition, the group issued 16.5 million stock to exchange 152.5 million Bulgari’s shares and also made Bulgari become the second-largest shareholder of LVMH. The chief executive of Bulgari, Francesco Trapani, became the head of Watch &amp; Jewellery, with the control of Zenith, Hublot and TAG Heuer according to the equity acquisition agreement. <br>
          <br>On the day of signing the acquisition, Bulgari’s market value raised up to 2.3 billion euros, which was 6.8 times its sales income and 28.2 times EBITDA. Though this unprecedented high premium fee of the Bulgari’s acquisition is opposite to LVMH’s strategy --- "always purchase at the lowest price”, it showed Bulgari's noble and scarce brand value and LVMH’s demand for a more balanced "Golden Triangle" on the business structure.<br>
          <br>After the acquisition of Bulgari, the group’s revenue started growing crazily, especially in China, South Korea and the Middle East. In 2015, Bulgari opened the largest jewelry production in Italy to support the business development and surpassed competitors in the Asia-Pacific market. According to data collected by Euromonitor, LVMH's market share in China even exceeded Richemont’s in 2011.<br>

      <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-1">The consolidation of Bulgari directly promoted the 97.8% growth in 2011’s sales income. This acquisition increased the revenue share of the Watch &amp; Jewelry division from 4.9% to 10%, which not only brought significant profit growth, but also made up for the business’ shortcomings. Now, the Watch &amp; Jewelry sector of LVMH stands at the top tier of the industry and keeps bringing abundant profits for the company.</p>

        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2">Mergers and acquisitions of global brands hedged risks from the single market and exchange rate. Compared with Richemont and Kering, LVMH has a richer category and a lower dependence on a single brand. According to the data from 2020’s annual report, the revenue of Wine &amp; Spirits, Fashion &amp; Leather Goods, Perfumes &amp; Cosmetics, Watches &amp; Jewelry and Selective Retailing accounted for 11%, 47%, 12%, 7%, and 23% respectively; while Richemont’s Jewelry and Watches section took 72% part and Kering's leather goods and sport wearing are 52% and 35% respectively, and revenue from Gucci occupied 59% of luxury apparel, which emphasis both Kering and Richemont showed a high degree of dependence on the single brand. The decentralized layout strategy helped LVMH grow steadily, and even in the face of financial crisis, the company achieved better performance than other competitors.<br>
          <br>Besides 51% of products produced by France, Italy, the United States, Switzerland, and Spain are also birthlands of other luxury brands, and the euro, US dollar, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar and other currencies distributed relatively averagely in the revenue of 2020.<br>

        </h3>
        <p class="u-align-left u-custom-font u-font-montserrat u-text u-text-body-alt-color u-text-2">Arnault attaches great importance to the absolute control of the group and has maintained more than 60% of the voting rights for lots of years. When Trapani, the CEO of Bulgari, just took over the power of Watch &amp; Jewelry division from the LVMH, revenue performed very well in the first year with the network of the LVMH. Based on the semi-annual report released in the first half of 2012, the income from Watches &amp; Jewelry rose up to 1.343 billion euros, which exceeded over 133% of the same period in 2011. However, due to decreased demands in China, the growth became much slower, by September 30, 2013, revenue from the Watch &amp; Jewellery segment fell 2.3% to 1.987 billion euros. This terrible result gave Arnault a chance to marginalize Trapani. In January 2014, LVMH stated that Trapani, the heir of the Bulgari family, would step down as CEO of LVMH's Watch &amp; Jewelry from March 1, 2014, and Trapani went to an Italian private equity fund Clessidra one month later.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Obtaining absolute control of Bulgari as Arnault wanted, he even ruthlessly fired the founding team of Celine and Givenchy, but showed more tolerance for the growing brands like Fresh or Benefit. Not only the whole original family was retained, but equity shares were kept at 30% up to now for the original stakeholder of Fresh.<br>
